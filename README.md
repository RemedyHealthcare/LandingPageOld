# Remedy Landing Page

A quick splash page for Remedy. 

### Files & Assets

Page is generated via PHP since Heroku requires it. Otherwise, the static page also generates with just index.html. Styles are generated by SASS -- any changes to style.css will be overridden by style.scss when compiled.

index.html: basic static markup

style.scss: basic sass file with style variables for reference

style.css: output from compiling sass (changes will not be saved)

index.php: one line of PHP to aid in deployment to Heroku

### Hosting

Previously splash page was hosted on Heroku at remedyapp.herokuapp.com by Jessica.

Now landing page is hosted on AWS S3 and CloudFront by Nikhil. If you have changes that need to be redeployed, file a pull request.
